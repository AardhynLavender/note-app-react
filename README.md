# Notes App

A minimal notes app written in React and TypeScript.

Aiming to do a small set of things really really well. So simple the software doesn't even have a name.

- Simple
- Keyboard navigable
- Markdown
- Fast
- Platform agnostic

And ideally

- Vim mode
- Offline
- Shareable content
- Command palette
